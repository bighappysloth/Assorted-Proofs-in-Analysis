\subsection{Theorem 4.3}
\begin{wts}
    For every $\Epsilon\subseteq\mathbb{P}(X)$, $\Epsilon$ is base for a topology on $X$ if and only if
    \begin{enumalpha}
        \item each $x\in X$ is contained in some $V\in\Epsilon$, and
        \item if $U, V\in\Epsilon$, and $x\in U\cap V$, then there must exist some $W\in \Epsilon$ with $x\in W\subseteq U\cap V$.
    \end{enumalpha}
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $\Epsilon$ is a base, then we get a), and b) follows since for every $U, V\in \Epsilon\subseteq \Tau_X$, and by closure over finite intersections, $U\cap V\in\Tau_X$ implies that there exists some $W\in\Epsilon$  with
    \[
    x\in W\subseteq U\cap V
    \]
    Now, suppose both a) and b) hold, then we claim that this $\Epsilon\subseteq\mathbb{P}(X)$ induces a topology on $X$
    \[
    \Tau = \left\{U\subseteq X,\:\forall x\in U,\:\exists V\in \Epsilon, \text{ with } x\in V\subseteq U\right\}
    \]
    Intuitively speaking, this means that $\Tau$ is just fine (and not too fine) to satisfy the conditions for $E\subseteq \Tau$ to be a base of $\Tau$.\\
    
    We first show that $\Tau$ is a topology.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\varnothing\in\Tau$ and $X\in \Tau$, the first is trivial and the second is from a)
        \item Closure under unions: fix $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}\subseteq \Tau$, and $U = \bigcup U_\alpha$, and for every $x\in U$ there exists some $V_\alpha\in\Epsilon$ such that $x\in V_\alpha\subseteq U_\alpha\subseteq U$, therefore $U\in \Tau$.
        \item Closure under finite intersections, fix any $U_1$, $U_2$ as elements in $\Tau$, then suppose that they are not disjoint (if they are disjoint then their intersection is the empty set, which is also contained in $\Tau$). If $U_1\cap U_2\neq\varnothing$, then for every $x\in U_1\cap U_2$ induces two sets $V_1, V_2\in\Epsilon$ with $x\in V_1\subseteq U_2$ and $x\in V_2\subseteq U_2$, taking their intersection and applying b) gives us some $V\subseteq V_1\cap V_2$ with $V\in\Epsilon$ therefore $x\in V\subseteq U_1\cap U_2$, and $\Tau$ is closed under finite intersections.
    \end{itemize}
    Now to show that $\Epsilon$ is a base for $\Tau$, $\Epsilon\subseteq\Tau$ is obvious since very $V\in\Epsilon$ satisfies the properties laid out by $\Tau$ by simply choosing $V$ again for any $x\in V$. Now fix any member $U\in \Tau$, then for every $x\in U$, there exists some $V\in \Epsilon$ with
    \[
    x\in V\subseteq U
    \]
    (This is an immediate consequence of how we defined $\Tau$). And we can conclude that $\Epsilon$ is a base for this induced topology $\Tau$.
\end{proof}
