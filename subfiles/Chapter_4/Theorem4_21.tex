\subsection{Theorem 4.21}
\begin{wts}
A topological space $X$ is compact $\iff$ every family of closed sets, $\{F_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ that has the finite intersection property, implies that 
\[
\bigcap_{\alpha\in A}F_\alpha\neq\varnothing
\]
\end{wts}
\newcommand{\fa}{\{F_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}}
\newcommand{\ua}{\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}}
\begin{proof}
We first examine the assertion, Theorem 4.21 proposes for any family of closed sets $\{F_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$, and for every finite subset $B\subseteq A$ then,
\[
\bigcap_{\alpha\in B} F_\alpha\neq\varnothing\implies\bigcap_{\alpha\in A}F_\alpha\neq\varnothing
\]
Taking the contrapositive (which is logically equivalent), we get
\[
\bigcap_{\alpha\in A}F_\alpha=\varnothing\implies \text{there exists a finite } B\subseteq A, \bigcap_{\alpha\in B}F_\alpha = \varnothing
\]
Applying DeMorgan's theorem, and since every $\fa$ induces a family of open sets (and vice versa), where $U_\alpha=F_\alpha^c$, so for any familiy of open sets $\ua$ we have
\[
\bigcup_{\alpha\in A}U_\alpha = X\implies \text{there exists a finite } B\subseteq A, \bigcup_{\alpha\in B}U_\alpha = X
\]
Which is equivalent to saying that $X$ is compact.
\end{proof}
