\subsection{Theorem 4.9}
\begin{wts}
    If $\Epsilon_Y$ generates the topology on $Y$, and $f$ is a mapping from $X\to Y$, then $f:X\to Y$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(V)\in \Tau_X$ for every $V\in \Epsilon_Y$.
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    The inverse image commutes with intersections, complements, and unions. To prove $\impliedby$, use Theorem 4.4, since every $U\in \Tau_Y$ can be represented the union of finite intersections of elements $\Epsilon_Y$, and use the fact that $\Tau_X$ is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections.\\
    
    To show $\implies$, since $\Epsilon_Y\subseteq \Tau_Y$, if $f^{-1}$ is open for every $U\in\Tau_Y$, then it is open for every $U\in \Epsilon_Y$ as well.
\end{proof}
