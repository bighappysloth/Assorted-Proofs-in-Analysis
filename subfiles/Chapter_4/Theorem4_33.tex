\subsection{Theorem 4.33}
\begin{wts}
    Every LCH space is completely regular (or $T_{3.5}$).
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    Recall that a space $X$ is completely regular if it is $T_1$ and every closed subset $A$ and every $x\notin A$ there exists some 
    \[
    f\in C(X,[0,1]),\quad f(x)=1,\:f|_A = 0
    \]
    Fix a closed set $A\subseteq X$, then for every $x\in A^c$, there exists a compact $E_x\in\nb{x}$ with $E_x\subseteq A^c$ (by Theorem 4.30).\\ 
    
    Note that $E_x\subseteq A^c$ where $E_x$ is compact and $A^c$ is closed, then an application of Theorem 4.31 tell us that there exists an $f\in C(X,[0,1])$ such that for every $x\in E_x$, $f(x)=1$ and for points $y\notin A^c$ (which means that $y\in A$), $f(y)=0$. Therefore $X$ is completely regular.
\end{proof}
