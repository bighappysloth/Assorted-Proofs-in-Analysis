\subsection{Theorem 4.5}
\begin{wts}
    Every second countable space is separable. (Countable dense subset).
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
What we wish to prove is that if a space $X$ has a countable base, then it has a countable dense subset. Denote this base of $X$ by $\Epsilon$ as usual, then we claim that 
\[
W = \{x_u,\:U\in\Epsilon\}
\]
Is a dense subset in $X$. Note that $\clc{W}= W^{co}\in\Tau_X$. If $W^{co}=\varnothing$ then we simply take complements and we get $\cl{W}=X$. So suppose that $W^{co}$ is non-empty, then for each $x\in W^{co}$ (by definition of a base), it should induce some $V_x\in\Epsilon$ with
\[
x\in V_x\subseteq W^{co}
\]
But clearly, for every element in $\Epsilon$, the second estimate can never be satisfies, since for every $U\in\Epsilon$, $x_U\notin W^{co}$ for this particular set $W^{co}$. Therefore $W^{co}$ must be empty, and this completes the proof.
\end{proof}
