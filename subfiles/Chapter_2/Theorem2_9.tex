\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:sequence converges to sum}
    Let $\xn$, and $\yn$ be sequences of reals, and if $x_n\to x$ and $y_n\to y$, then $x_n+y_n\to x+y$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Fix an $\varepsilon>0$, cut our $\varepsilon$ into half, so that $\xn$, and $\yn$ lies in a half-$\varepsilon$ ball about their limits eventually. Then, take the triangle inequality, since the above estimate holds eventually, $|x_n+y_n-(x+y)|<\varepsilon$ eventually as well.
\end{proof}
