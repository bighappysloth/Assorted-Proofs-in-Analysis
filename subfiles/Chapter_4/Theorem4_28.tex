\subsection{Theorem 4.28}
\begin{wts}
If $X$ is compact, and if $Y$ is Hausdorff, then any continuous bijection $f:X\to Y$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
If $E\in X$ is closed, then since $X$ is compact, $E$ is compact as well. By continuity of $f$, $f(X)$ is a compact set in $Y$, but compact subsets of $Y$ are closed, so $f$ is continuous.\\

We used the fact that the inverse of $f^{-1}$ is $f$, since it suffices to check that every inverse image of a closed set is also closed, $f^{-1}$ is continuous. And by definition of a homeomorphism ($f$ has to be bijective and both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ hav eto be continuous), $f$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{proof}
