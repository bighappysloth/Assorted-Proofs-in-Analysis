\subsection{Theorem 4.25}
\begin{wts}
Every compact Hausdorff ($T_2$) space is normal ($T_4$).
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
Fix $A$, $B$ which are disjoint closed subsets of $X$, by Theorem 4.22, we know that these two sets are compact. Hence for every $y\in B$ there exists two disjoint open sets $U, V_y$ (by Theorem 4.23)\\

$A\subseteq U_y$ and $y\in V_y$. But the family $\{V_y\}_{y\in B}$ is s a valid open cover for the compact set $B$, hence there exists a finite subcollection $H\subseteq B$ such that 
\[
B\subseteq \bigcup_{y\in H}V_y,\quad U_y\cap V_y=\varnothing
\]
The second equality holds for every $y\in H$ so that $U_y\cap(\cup V_{y\in H})=\varnothing$. Define $U = \cap U_{y\in H}$ and $V = \cup V_{y\in H}$, where both of these are disjoint open sets that that contain $A$ and $B$ as subsets, since for each $y\in H$, $A\subseteq U_y$ hence the intersection of all $U_y$ also contains $A$ as a subset. Therefore $X$ is normal.
\end{proof}
