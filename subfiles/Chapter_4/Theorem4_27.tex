\subsection{Theorem 4.27}
\begin{wts}
If $X$ is compact, then $C(X)=BC(X)$.
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
Notice that $BC(X)\subseteq C(X)$, so we only have to show the reverse estimate. Fix any $f\in C(X)$, since $X$ is compact, by Theorem 4.26 we know that $f(X)$ is also compact. Since $\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}^2$ is a complete metric space, $f(X)$ is bounded and $f\in BC(X)$.
\end{proof}
