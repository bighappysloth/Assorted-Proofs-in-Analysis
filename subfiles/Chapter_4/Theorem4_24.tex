\subsection{Theorem 4.24}
\begin{wts}
Every compact subset of a Hausdorff ($T_2$) space is closed.
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
If $F$ is compact, then for every $x\in F^c$, by Theorem 4.23, there exists two disjoint open sets such that $x\in U$ and $F\subseteq V$, but 
\[
U\cap V = \varnothing\implies U\cap F=\varnothing\implies U\subseteq F^c
\]
But since $x\in F^c$ is arbitrary, and $U$ is an open subset of $F^c$, 
\[
x\in U\subseteq F^{co}\implies F^c\subseteq F^{co}
\]
Which shows that $F^c$ is open and $F$ is closed.
\end{proof}
