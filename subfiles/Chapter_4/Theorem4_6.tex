\subsection{Theorem 4.6}
\begin{wts}
    If $X$ is first countable, then for every $A\subseteq X$, $x\in \cl{A}\iff$ there exists some sequence $\{x_j\}_{j\geq 1}\subseteq A$ such that $x_j\to x$.
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $X$ is first countable, and $A\subseteq X$, and fix any element $x\in\cl{A}$. Since $X$ is first countable, there is a sequence of descending neighbourhoods of $\{U_j\}_{j\geq 1}$ of $x$ such that
    \[
    U_1\supseteq U_2\supseteq \cdots\supseteq U_j\supseteq U_{j+1}
    \]
    If $x\in A$, take $x_n = x$ for all $n\geq 1$. If $x\in\acc{(A)}$, then take $x_n\in U_n\cap A\setminus \{x\}=U_n\cap A$, which is not empty. Then it remains to show that this sequence converges to $x$. Fix any neighbourhood $U\in\nb{x}$ then there exists some $N$, for every $n\geq N$
    \[
    x\in U^o\implies \exists N\in\nat^+, \: x\in U_N\subseteq U^o
    \]
    Then every $x_n\in A\cap U_N\subseteq A\cap U^o\subseteq U^o$. And this establishes $\implies$.\\
    
    Now suppose that $x\notin \cl{A}$, so that $x\notin A$ and $x\notin \acc{(A)}$, then fix any sequence $\{x_j\}\subseteq A$. We wish to show that $x_j\not\to x$.\\
    
    Since $x\notin \acc{(A)}$, there exists some $V\in\nb{X}$ with
    \[
    A\cap V\setminus\{x\}=\varnothing\implies V\subseteq A^c
    \]
    Since $\{x_j\}_{j\geq 1}\subseteq A\implies x_j\notin A^c$ for every $j\geq 1$, then choose $V$ as the neighbourhood around $x$, and $x_j\not\to x$ for any arbitrary sequence $x_j$ in $A$.
\end{proof}
\remark To truly understand what is going on one should recall that all metric space spaces are first countable.
