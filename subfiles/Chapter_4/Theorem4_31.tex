\subsection{Theorem 4.31}
\begin{wts}
    $X$ is a LCH space, and $K\subseteq U\subseteq X$ where $K$ is compact, and $U$ is open, then there exists some precompact, open $V$ with
    \[
    K\subseteq V\subseteq \cl{V}\subseteq U
    \]
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
    For every $x\in K$, we can apply Proposition 4.30, since $x\in K\subseteq U$, this induces some compact $F_x\subseteq U$ where $F_x\in\nb{x}$. Then we can obtain an open cover of $U$ in the form of $\{F_x^o\}_{x\in K}$. By compactness of $K$, there exists a finite $B\subseteq K$ such that 
    \[
    K\subseteq \bigcup_{x\in B} F_x^o
    \]
    Let $V = \bigcup_{x\in B}F_x^o$, then clearly $V$ is open, and $K\subseteq V$. Since each $F_x$ is closed (compact sets are closed in any Hausdorff Space), we have
    \[
    V\subseteq \bigcup_{x\in B}F_x\implies\cl{V}\subseteq\bigcup_{x\in B}F_x
    \]
    Since $\bigcup_{x\in B}F_x$ is a finite union of compact sets, we claim that it is also compact. Consider two compact sets $E_1$ and $E_2$, then if $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ is any open cover of $E_1\cup E_2$, it must be an open cover for $E_1$ and $E_2$ as well, because
    \[
    E_1,E_2\subseteq E_1\cup E_2 \bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_\alpha
    \]
    Since $E_1$ and $E_2$ are both compact sets, they each induce two finite subsets of $B_1$, $B_2$ of $A$ whose union $B = B_1\cup B_2$ is also compact. Therefore
    \[
    E_1\cup E_2 \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha\in B}U_\alpha
    \]
    Then a simple proof by induction will show that if $\{E_{j\leq n}\}$ is a family of compact sets, then $E = \bigcup E_{j\leq n}$ is also compact.\\
    
    Returning to the main part of the proof, $\bigcup_{x\in B}F_x$ is a compact set, therefore $\cl{V}$ is also compact. Moreover
    \[
    \forall x\in K,\: F_x\subseteq U\implies \cl{V}\subseteq\bigcup_{x\in B}F_x\subseteq U
    \]
    Combining, we have
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $K\subseteq V\subseteq \cl{V}$, 
        \item $V$ is open and $\cl{V}$ is compact, and
        \item $\cl{V}\subseteq U$
    \end{itemize}
    This completes the proof.
\end{proof}
