\subsection{Theorem 4.7}
\begin{wts}
$X$ is a $T_1$ space $\iff \{x\}$ is closed for every $x\in X$.
\end{wts}
\begin{proof}
If $X$ is $T_1$ and $x\in X$, then for every $y\neq x$ there exists some open $U_y$ that contains $y$ but not $x$. Following Folland's argument closely, every $y\neq x$ is is in $\cup U_{y\neq x}$. Hence $\{x\}^c\subseteq \cup U_{y\neq x}$. To show the converse, for every $z\in\cup U_{y\neq x}$ that is open, there exists a $y\neq x$ such that $z\in U_y$. But every $U_y$ does not contain $x$ as an element, so $z\neq x$ implies that $z\notin \{x\}$. And $z\in \{x\}^c$. Hence $\cup U_{y\neq x} = \{x\}^c$.\\

Now conversely if every $x\in X$ satisfies the fact that $\{x\}^c$ is open, then $\{x\}^c$ is an open set that contains every $y\neq x$. Now fix some $y\neq x$, since $\{y\}$ is also closed, we have $X\cap \{x\}^c$ is an open set that contains $x$ but not y. Also, $\{x\}^c$ is an open set that contains $y$ but not $x$. And therefore $X$ is $T_1$.
\end{proof}
